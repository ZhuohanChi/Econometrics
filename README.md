Major focus will be on time series econometrics, which is the branch of statistics that models
how processes evolve over time, and how their values at any two dates are potentially connected to
each other. A major application of time series econometrics is developing techniques for forecasting
data that rely mainly on information about their recent values, rather than economic insights.
This will start with forecasting techniques based on smoothing, which are very popular and easy to
apply in practice. Then switch to analysis based on the ARMA framework. This framework will
deliver comparable forecasts to the smoothing approach, but with a clearer grounding in statistical
theory that offers more opportunities for analysis beyond pure forecasting. Finally, there will be
models of volatility. These can also be divided into smoothing-based and ARMA-based approaches.
